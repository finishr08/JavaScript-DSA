## Loops (for loop, while loop, dowhile loop)

### Achievement

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
